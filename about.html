	<p>ðŸ‘¾ Junior full-stack developer, passionate about building user-friendly and responsive websites. Through my studies, I've gained a solid understanding of web development concepts, and have dedicated a lot of time to applying these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications. When I'm not working, learning, and thinking about how to make things better, you can catch me watching football matches. âš½</p>
